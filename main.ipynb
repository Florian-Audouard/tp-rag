Broader Impact\\n\\nWe introduce Video-Panda, an encoder-free Video Lan- guage Model for video understanding. Our model addresses key ethical and practical challenges in large-scale AI de- ployment. While many VLMs raise concerns about data bias, privacy, and computational costs, Video-Panda miti- gates these issues through two key design choices: training exclusively on publicly available datasets and eliminating the need for a pretrained encoder. This approach not only reduces ethical concerns but also significantly lowers com- putational requirements and deployment costs, making the model more accessible and environmentally sustainable.')]"
